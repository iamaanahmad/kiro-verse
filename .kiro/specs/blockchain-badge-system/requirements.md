# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Blockchain Badge System is KiroVerse's standout feature that creates real, verifiable skill credentials on the blockchain. When users demonstrate programming skills in their code, the system automatically mints NFT badges on the Sepolia testnet, creating permanent, unfakeable credentials that can be verified by third parties through blockchain explorers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to earn real blockchain credentials when I demonstrate programming skills, so that I have verifiable proof of my abilities that employers and peers can trust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit code that demonstrates a specific programming skill THEN the system SHALL analyze the code and identify the skill demonstrated
2. WHEN a skill is identified THEN the system SHALL automatically mint an NFT badge on the Sepolia testnet
3. WHEN the badge is minted THEN the system SHALL provide me with a transaction hash that links to Etherscan for verification
4. WHEN the badge is created THEN it SHALL include a unique, AI-generated icon specific to the skill

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my skill badges to be truly verifiable and permanent, so that I can trust they will always be available as proof of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a badge is minted THEN it SHALL be stored on the public Sepolia testnet blockchain
2. WHEN someone wants to verify my badge THEN they SHALL be able to view it on Etherscan using the transaction hash
3. WHEN the badge is created THEN it SHALL follow the ERC-721 NFT standard for maximum compatibility
4. WHEN I view my badges THEN the system SHALL display the blockchain transaction details for each badge

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each badge to have a unique visual representation, so that my achievements are distinctive and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a badge is generated THEN the system SHALL create a unique icon using AI image generation
2. WHEN the icon is created THEN it SHALL follow a consistent visual theme (dark, futuristic, vector-style)
3. WHEN multiple badges are earned for the same skill THEN each SHALL have a unique visual variation
4. WHEN the badge is displayed THEN it SHALL show both the skill name and the generated icon

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the badge system to be secure and reliable, so that I can trust the integrity of my credentials and the system won't be exploited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN badges are minted THEN the system SHALL use a secure server-side wallet to prevent unauthorized minting
2. WHEN code is analyzed for skills THEN the system SHALL validate that the skill is genuinely demonstrated
3. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent badge farming
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily view and manage my earned badges, so that I can track my progress and share my achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I earn badges THEN the system SHALL store badge metadata in my user profile
2. WHEN I view my profile THEN I SHALL see all my earned badges with their icons and skill names
3. WHEN I want to share a badge THEN I SHALL be able to copy the Etherscan link for verification
4. WHEN I view badge details THEN I SHALL see the date earned, transaction hash, and skill description
