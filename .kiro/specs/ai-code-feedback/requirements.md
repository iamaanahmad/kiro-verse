# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Code Feedback System is the core mentorship feature of KiroVerse that provides intelligent, real-time analysis and guidance for user-submitted code. This system acts as a Socratic-style AI tutor named Kiro, offering detailed feedback on code quality, potential errors, best practices, and improvement suggestions to help developers enhance their coding skills in an interactive learning environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning to code, I want to submit my code and receive detailed AI analysis, so that I can understand what I'm doing well and what needs improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pastes or types code into the editor THEN the system SHALL accept code in multiple programming languages
2. WHEN a user requests feedback THEN the system SHALL analyze the code using AI and provide comprehensive feedback within 10 seconds
3. WHEN feedback is generated THEN the system SHALL include code quality assessment, error identification, and improvement suggestions
4. WHEN feedback is displayed THEN the system SHALL present it in a clear, structured format that is easy to understand

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have a conversational chat with the AI mentor about my code, so that I can ask specific questions and get contextual guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the chat interface THEN the system SHALL provide a conversational AI chat powered by Genkit flows
2. WHEN a user asks a question about their code THEN the AI SHALL provide context-aware responses related to the submitted code
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN it SHALL use a Socratic teaching method to guide understanding rather than just giving direct answers
4. WHEN multiple questions are asked THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context throughout the session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI feedback to be educational and mentorship-focused, so that I can learn coding best practices and improve my skills over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing feedback THEN the AI SHALL focus on educational value and skill development
2. WHEN identifying issues THEN the AI SHALL explain why something is problematic and suggest specific improvements
3. WHEN suggesting improvements THEN the AI SHALL provide examples of better code patterns when applicable
4. WHEN analyzing code THEN the AI SHALL consider industry best practices and coding standards

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the feedback system to be reliable and handle errors gracefully, so that I can trust the system and have a smooth learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and suggest trying again
2. WHEN invalid code is submitted THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and provide helpful guidance
3. WHEN the system encounters an error THEN it SHALL log the error for debugging while showing a user-friendly message
4. WHEN the system is processing THEN it SHALL show appropriate loading indicators to keep users informed
