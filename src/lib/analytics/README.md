## Usage

### Basic Code Analysis

```typescript
import { SkillProgressTracker } from '@/lib/analytics';

// Analyze a code submission
const result = await SkillProgressTracker.analyzeCodeSubmission(
  'user123',
  codeString,
  'Context description'
);

console.log('Detected skills:', result.aiAnalysis.detectedSkills);
console.log('Skill improvements:', result.skillImprovements);
console.log('Learning insights:', result.learningInsights);
```

### Convenience Functions

```typescript
import { 
  analyzeAndTrackProgress, 
  getUserSkillProgress, 
  getUserLearningInsights 
} from '@/lib/analytics';

// Analyze code and track progress
const analytics = await analyzeAndTrackProgress(userId, code, context);

// Get user's current skill progression
const progress = await getUserSkillProgress(userId);

// Get user's learning insights
const insights = await getUserLearningInsights(userId, true); // unread only
```

### Configuration Options

```typescript
const options = {
  enableRealTimeAnalysis: true,  // Update user progress immediately
  generateInsights: true,        // Generate learning insights
  updateBenchmarks: true,        // Update industry benchmarks
  trackLearningVelocity: true    // Calculate learning velocity
};

const result = await SkillProgressTracker.analyzeCodeSubmission(
  userId, 
  code, 
  context, 
  options
);
```

## Data Models

### AnalyticsData
Contains the complete analysis results for a code submission:
- Session ID and user ID
- Code submission details and metrics
- AI analysis results
- Skill improvements detected
- Generated learning insights
- Processing status and timestamps

### UserProgress
Tracks a user's overall skill progression:
- Skill levels map with experience points
- Learning velocity and code quality trends
- Challenge completions and peer interactions
- Historical progress data

### SkillLevel
Represents proficiency in a specific skill:
- Current level and experience points
- Competency areas and industry benchmarks
- Progress history with milestones
- Verification status and trend direction

### LearningInsight
Personalized learning recommendations:
- Type (strength, improvement_area, recommendation)
- Category and priority level
- Actionable steps and confidence score
- Read status and expiration date

## Skill Categories

The system recognizes skills across multiple categories:

- **JavaScript**: promises, async-await, closures, prototypes, es6-features
- **TypeScript**: interfaces, generics, type-guards, decorators, advanced-types
- **React**: hooks, components, state-management, lifecycle, context
- **Node.js**: modules, streams, events, file-system, http
- **Database**: queries, optimization, transactions, modeling, indexing
- **Testing**: unit-tests, integration-tests, mocking, tdd, coverage
- **Security**: authentication, authorization, encryption, validation, sanitization
- **Performance**: optimization, caching, profiling, memory-management, algorithms

## Experience and Leveling System

### Experience Thresholds
- **Beginner**: 0-99 experience points
- **Intermediate**: 100-499 experience points
- **Advanced**: 500-1499 experience points
- **Expert**: 1500+ experience points

### Experience Calculation
- Base experience gain: 10 points per submission
- Quality multiplier: Based on code quality score (0-100%)
- Skill relevance multiplier: 1.5x for directly demonstrated skills
- Level up bonus: 50 additional points

## AI Integration

The system integrates with existing KiroVerse AI flows:

### sendChatMessage Flow
Used for comprehensive code analysis and feedback generation. Provides:
- Code quality assessment
- Efficiency and creativity scoring
- Best practices evaluation
- Improvement suggestions

### awardSkillBadge Flow
Used for skill detection and badge recommendations. Provides:
- Specific skill identification
- Badge name and description
- Skill demonstration evidence

## Database Operations

### UserProgressService
- `getUserProgress(userId)`: Retrieve user's progress data
- `createUserProgress(progress)`: Create new user progress record
- `updateUserProgress(userId, updates)`: Update existing progress
- `updateSkillLevel(userId, skillLevel)`: Update specific skill level

### AnalyticsDataService
- `saveAnalyticsData(data)`: Store analysis results
- `getAnalyticsData(userId, limit)`: Retrieve user's analytics history
- `getAnalyticsDataBySession(sessionId)`: Get specific session data

### LearningInsightsService
- `saveLearningInsight(insight)`: Store learning insight
- `getUserLearningInsights(userId, unreadOnly)`: Get user insights
- `markInsightAsRead(insightId)`: Mark insight as read
- `deleteExpiredInsights()`: Clean up expired insights

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

- Code analysis and skill detection
- Experience calculation and level progression
- Learning insights generation
- Error handling and edge cases
- Database operations and data consistency

Run tests with:
```bash
npm run test:run -- src/lib/analytics/__tests__/skill-progress-tracker.test.ts
```

## Error Handling

The system implements robust error handling:

- **Graceful Degradation**: Core functionality remains available when advanced features fail
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Failed AI analyses are queued for retry
- **Fallback Systems**: Basic progress tracking when advanced analytics are unavailable
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All errors are logged with context for debugging

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: AI analysis results are cached to improve response times
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple skill updates can be processed in batches
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing for analytics queries
- **Rate Limiting**: AI service calls are managed to prevent overload

## Security and Privacy

- **Data Protection**: User code is encrypted and securely stored
- **Access Controls**: Proper authentication and authorization checks
- **Anonymization**: Personal identifiers are removed from analytics processing
- **Audit Trails**: All skill progression changes are logged with timestamps

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Real-time collaborative analysis
- Advanced benchmark comparisons
- Machine learning-based skill prediction
- Integration with external coding platforms
- Enhanced visualization and reporting

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the Advanced Learning Analytics specification:

- **1.1**: Tracks skill progression across different programming concepts
- **1.2**: Displays visual analytics showing improvement trends
- **1.4**: Measures code quality improvement and best practice adoption
- **6.1**: Learns user coding patterns for personalized feedback

The system provides a solid foundation for the advanced learning analytics features while maintaining integration with KiroVerse's existing AI and blockchain infrastructure.
