## 🚀 What is KiroVerse?

KiroVerse is the world's first **AI-powered interactive learning environment** that combines intelligent code mentorship with **real, verifiable blockchain credentials**. Think of it as your personal code-dojo where every skill you demonstrate earns you an actual NFT badge on the blockchain.

### 🎯 The Problem We Solve

- **Fake Credentials**: Traditional coding certificates can be easily faked
- **Isolated Learning**: Developers learn in silos without personalized guidance  
- **No Proof of Skills**: Hard to verify actual coding abilities to employers
- **Generic Feedback**: Most tools give generic advice, not personalized mentorship

### 💡 Our Revolutionary Solution

KiroVerse creates **unfakeable proof** of your coding skills through:
- 🤖 **AI Socratic Mentorship** - Kiro guides your learning with intelligent questions
- 🏅 **Real NFT Skill Badges** - Earn verifiable credentials on Sepolia blockchain
- 🎨 **AI-Generated Badge Art** - Unique icons created by multimodal AI
- 📋 **Transparent Development** - See exactly how AI builds software (educational!)

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 AI-Powered Code Mentorship
```typescript
// Submit your code and get intelligent feedback
const feedback = await getCodeFeedback(`
  function fetchUser(id) {
    return fetch('/api/users/' + id)
      .then(res => res.json())
  }
`);
// Kiro responds: "Great start! Let's explore error handling..."
```

### 💬 Conversational AI Chat
- Ask specific questions about your code
- Get context-aware responses that reference your submission
- Socratic teaching method that guides discovery rather than giving direct answers

### 🏆 Blockchain Skill Badges
When you demonstrate a programming skill, KiroVerse automatically:
1. **Analyzes** your code with AI to identify the skill
2. **Generates** a unique badge icon using multimodal AI
3. **Mints** a badge (demo mode: instant mock / production mode: real NFT on Sepolia)
4. **Provides** an Etherscan link for verification

**Demo Mode Toggle**: 
- ⚡ **Demo Mode**: Instant badge creation with mock transactions (perfect for demonstrations)
- 🔗 **Production Mode**: Real NFT minting on Sepolia testnet (verifiable blockchain credentials)

**Example Badge Transaction**: [View on Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xc2a95072d7d68b0d085991d75e79eee7b2e5db051bd169cbf2f117ab5b22a1a9)
