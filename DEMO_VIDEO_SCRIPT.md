# üé¨ KiroVerse Demo Video Script
**Duration: 3 minutes | Target: "Code with Kiro" Hackathon Judges**

---

## üìù **Script Outline**

### **HOOK (0:00-0:15) - 15 seconds**
**[Screen: KiroVerse landing page]**

> **"What if I told you that every coding skill you demonstrate could earn you a real, unfakeable NFT certificate on the blockchain? Meet KiroVerse - where AI mentorship meets verifiable credentials."**

**[Quick montage: Code editor ‚Üí AI feedback ‚Üí Badge minting ‚Üí Blockchain verification]**

### **PROBLEM & SOLUTION (0:15-0:45) - 30 seconds**
**[Screen: Split view - fake certificates vs real blockchain]**

> **"Traditional coding certificates can be easily faked. Developers learn in isolation without personalized guidance. And there's no reliable way to prove your actual coding skills to employers."**

**[Transition to KiroVerse interface]**

> **"KiroVerse solves this with AI-powered Socratic mentorship and real blockchain credentials. Built entirely with Kiro's spec-driven development and agent orchestration."**

---

### **KIRO INTEGRATION SHOWCASE (0:45-1:15) - 30 seconds**
**[Screen: File explorer showing .kiro directory]**

> **"Let me show you how Kiro powers everything. Our entire development process is spec-driven..."**

**[Navigate through .kiro/specs/blockchain-badge-system/]**
- **Requirements.md** - "Clear requirements documentation"
- **Design.md** - "Detailed system architecture" 
- **Tasks.md** - "Structured implementation plan"

**[Show .kiro/hooks/badge-generation-hook.md]**

> **"Agent hooks orchestrate complex workflows - from AI skill analysis to blockchain minting. This isn't just using Kiro's APIs - it's embracing the entire Kiro philosophy."**

---

### **CORE DEMO - PART 1: AI MENTORSHIP (1:15-2:00) - 45 seconds**
**[Screen: KiroVerse code editor]**

> **"Watch this in action. I'll submit some JavaScript code with an error..."**

**[Type problematic async code]**
```javascript
function fetchUser(id) {
  return fetch('/api/users/' + id)
    .then(res => res.json())
    // Missing error handling
}
```

**[Click "Get AI Feedback"]**
> **"Instead of giving direct answers, Kiro guides discovery through Socratic questioning..."**

**[Show AI response highlighting the mentorship approach]**

**[Demonstrate chat feature]**
> **"I can ask follow-up questions, and the AI maintains context about my code..."**

---

### **CORE DEMO - PART 2: BLOCKCHAIN BADGES (2:00-2:45) - 45 seconds**
**[Screen: Fixed code with proper error handling]**

> **"Now I'll submit improved code demonstrating error handling skills..."**

**[Submit corrected code]**
**[Click "Analyze for Skills" button]**

> **"Watch as multiple AI agents work together: First, skill detection analyzes the code... Then multimodal AI generates a unique badge icon... Finally, it mints a real NFT on Sepolia testnet."**

**[Show the badge generation process in real-time]**
**[Display the generated badge with unique artwork]**
**[Show blockchain transaction hash]**

> **"This isn't a demo - it's a real blockchain transaction!"**

---

### **VERIFICATION & IMPACT (2:45-3:00) - 15 seconds**
**[Screen: Etherscan showing the actual transaction]**

> **"Here's the proof - verifiable on Etherscan. Employers can trust these credentials because they're mathematically impossible to fake."**

**[Screen: User profile showing multiple earned badges]**

> **"KiroVerse isn't just learning - it's building an unfakeable professional portfolio. Built with Kiro, powered by AI, secured by blockchain."**
