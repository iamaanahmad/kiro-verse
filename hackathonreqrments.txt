KiroVerse project is extremely well aligned with the official “Code with Kiro Hackathon” requirements and judging criteria. Here’s the breakdown of key requirements and how your project matches them:

📝 Official Requirements & Judging Criteria
1. Must Build with Kiro
Use Kiro’s developer tools, APIs, spec-driven agent flows, and showcase them clearly.
KiroVerse:

Deep integration of Kiro spec-driven workflow (requirements, design, tasks) with user-visible “Behind the Scenes” views.

Extensive use of agent hooks and Genkit flows for real AI logic.

2. Functional Application
The solution must be installable, consistently runnable, and behave as shown in your demo/video.
KiroVerse:

Production-ready, deployed, with robust error handling and accessibility. All features described appear realized and tested.

3. Project Category Alignment
Accepts entries in “Educational Apps,” “Productivity & Workflow Tools,” or “Wildcard/Freestyle.”
KiroVerse:

Clearly belongs in Educational Apps, with elements that fit the Productivity & Workflow and Wildcard categories, giving flexibility in positioning.

4. Demo Video
Must include a public demo video (under 3 minutes), clearly showing how Kiro was used to build, automate, or accelerate features.
KiroVerse:

Your project summary suggests a clear, demo-friendly flow, easily organized to showcase Kiro’s value, AI agent orchestration, real blockchain minting, and spec-driven development.

5. Public Open Source Code & .kiro Directory
Submit a public repo with an OSI-approved license, explicit documentation, and a .kiro directory in the project root containing specs, hooks, and steering files.
KiroVerse:

Built with open source standards (TypeScript, Next.js) and strong documentation practices. Confirm your .kiro directory is present and well-documented.

6. Describe Kiro Usage in Submission
Include a writeup (in your Devpost, repo docs, and video) about how Kiro’s spec-driven approach, agent hooks, and automation shaped your development.
KiroVerse:

Spec-driven “Behind the Scenes” view, agent flows for chaining feedback and badge minting, and visible requirements/tasks all make for a compelling narrative.

7. Judging Criteria:
Potential Value: Wide usefulness, accessibility, real-world impact.

Implementation: Strong use of Kiro, including specs, flows, agents, and automation.

Quality of the Idea: Originality, creativity, unique technical integrations (e.g., using blockchain for verifiable credentials, multimodal icon generation, transparent AI).
KiroVerse:

High-value educational platform with portability, onboarding, mentorship, and professional achievement proof.

Sophisticated Kiro implementation with visible workflow and agent orchestration.

Uniquely creative with blockchain/NFT badges, multimodal AI, and transparent engineering.
